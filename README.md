# Reentrancy-Attack-
 Solidity Solution to reentrancy attack using OpenZeppelin 
 By using Reentrancy Gaurds in Open Zeppelins library we can easily stop recursive calls that would infeltrate a vulnerability 
 of someone being able to access our ether/funds and drain our account due to a mistake of the state of our contract not properly being
 updated. The balance needs to be refleted properly but more importantly we need a safe gaurd to protect us from such vulnerabilities
 when mistakes are made and Open Zeppelin does just that.
